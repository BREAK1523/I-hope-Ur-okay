            <p>Hi Vim, I just noticed you’ve been so distant with peoples in socmed these days, and you said it yourself that you’ve been avoiding people. Well unfortunately I can’t help myself but get worry about you (I JUST DON’T KNOW WHY).
                <br>
                <br>Well, we know na it's not always happy everyday, and it’s okay to feel sad sometimes, but don't let it disconnect you from people tihh. 
                <br>
                <br>Sometimes things can get really overwhelming and it’s hard to talk about it, but don't worry it'll pass and you'll be okay. I just want you to know that I'm here for you, and I care about you.
                <br>
                <br>I made this HTML, CSS, JS thingy hoping to help you with what you are going through but unfortunately, I can’t read what you wrote in that box (bummer Skill issue icy) but, I hope you'd feel lighter after expressing all of your hinanakit in that box.
            </p>
